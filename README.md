## Credits
Module 5 Mini Project helped me to reverse engineer many aspects of this app including the function to create cards and function for handleDeleteTask.

ChatGPT helped to brainstorm the below three aspects when asked about the snap abilities for the jQueryUI droppable method.
       `tolerance: 'pointer', // Helps in dropping exactly onto the droppable area
        snap: true, // Enables snapping
        snapMode: 'inner', // Snap to the inner area of droppable`
